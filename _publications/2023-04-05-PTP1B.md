Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious chronic disease with an alarmingly growing worldwide prevalence. Current treatment of T2DM mainly relies on drug combinations in order to control blood glucose levels and consequently prevent the onset of hyperglycaemia-related complications. The development of multiple-targeted drugs recently emerged as an attractive alternative to drug combinations for the treatment of complex diseases with multifactorial pathogenesis, such as T2DM. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and aldose reductase (AKR1B1) are two enzymes crucially involved in the development of T2DM and its chronic complications and, therefore, dual inhibitors targeted to both these enzymes could provide novel agents for the treatment of this complex pathological condition. In continuing our search for dual-targeted PTP1B/AKR1B1 inhibitors, we designed new (5-arylidene-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)alkanoic acids. Among them, 3-(4-phenylbutoxy)benzylidene derivatives 6f and 7f, endowed with interesting inhibitory activity against both targets, proved to control specific cellular pathways implicated in the development of T2DM and related complications.
