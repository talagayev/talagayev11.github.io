There are currently no small molecules clinically approved as immune checkpoint modulators. Besides possessing oral bioavailability, cell-penetrating capabilities and enhanced tumor penetration compared to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 
small molecules are amenable to pharmacokinetic optimization, which allows adopting flexible dosage regimens that may avoid immune-related adverse events associated with mAbs. 
The interaction of inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) with its ligand (ICOS-L) plays key roles in T-cell differentiation and activation of T-cell to B-cell functions. 
This study represents the development and validation of a virtual screening strategy to identify small molecules that bind a novel druggable binding pocket in human ICOS. 
We used a lipophilic canyon in the apo-structure of ICOS and the ICOS/ICOS-L interface individually as templates for molecular dynamics simulation to generate 3D pharmacophores 
subsequently used for virtual screening campaigns. Our strategy was successful finding a first-in-class small molecule ICOS binder (5P, KD value=108.08±26.76 μM) and 
validating biophysical screening platforms for ICOS-targeted small molecules.  We anticipate that future structural optimization of 5P 
will result in the discovery of high affinity chemical ligands for ICOS.
