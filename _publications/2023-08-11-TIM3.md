T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) is a negative immune checkpoint that represents a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. Although encouraging results have been observed for TIM-3 inhibition in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), targeting TIM-3 is currently restricted to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To fill this gap, we implemented a pharmacophore-based screening approach to identify small-molecule TIM-3 inhibitors. Our approach resulted in the identification of hit compounds with TIM-3 binding affinity. Subsequently, we used the structureâ€“activity relationship (SAR) by a catalog approach to identify compound A-41 with submicromolar TIM-3 binding affinity. Remarkably, A-41 demonstrated the ability to block TIM-3 interactions with key ligands and inhibited the immunosuppressive function of TIM-3 using an in vitro coculture assay. This work will pave the way for future drug discovery efforts aiming at the development of small-molecule inhibitors TIM-3 for AML.
