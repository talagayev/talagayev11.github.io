**Mentors**: CÃ©dric Bouysset ([@cbouy](https://github.com/cbouy)), Richard Gowers ([@richardjgowers](https://github.com/richardjgowers)) and Yuxuan Zhuang ([@yuxuanzhuang](https://github.com/yuxuanzhuang))

**Organization**: [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)

**Release**: [GSoC 2024: 2D visualization for small molecules Release](https://github.com/talagayev/MDonatello/releases/tag/0.0.1)

During the Google Summer of Code 2024 I was working on the 2D Visualization of small molecules, which is an important project, that would allow people to easily visualize the molecule that they have in their file
through the selection of the molecule as an `AtomGroup` in `MDAnalysis`.

## Goals of the project

The goal of the project was to create a code, that would allow the user to select an `AtomGroup` with the help of `MDAnalysis`, which would be used with an RDKit Converter to convert the molecule into an rdkit mol object, which would be used for the visualization.

My Proposal consisted of the following steps:

- Select the AtomGroup via an input from the user via `u = mda.Universe("input.pdb")` to create an MDAnalysis Universe and `ag = u.select_atoms("resname UNK")` to select the `AtomGroup` 
with the molecule that needs to be displayed
- Convert the selected AtomGroup into an rdkit mol object via `ag.convert_to("RDKit")`
- Apply `Chem.RemoveHs` and `AllChem.Compute2DCoords` to obtain a 2D visualization of the molecule
- Display the molecule via `IpyWidgets` with different checkboxes, that by selection would highlight specific parts of the molecule

After discussion with the mentors and suggestions regarding how the code should be structured, it was decided that I would proceed with this suggestion and would apply the following steps with later on adding the additional
features in the `IpyWidgets` visualization, which would give the user important information in regards to the characteristics of the molecule that is being visualized.

## What I did

I would divide this section into separate parts, each highlighting one of the important aspects of the work.

### Main Visualization Code

The main part of the code consisted of setting up the code for the visualization, which would allow the display of the molecule in a jupyter notebook. This is performed in the 
`mdonatello.py`, which is mainly responsible for the visualization with it having the `class MoleculeVisualizer` that is the main class and responsible for the visualization with
the functions in this class initializing the `IpyWidgets` interactive widgets such as a bar, that allows the user to select the molecule that he wants to display and also the
interactive checkboxes with each having a feature, that I would explain in a separate section.

This main code was the first part of the code that I designed and was in the beginning only able to display the molecule and had only one interactive checkbox, which displayed the atom
indices of the molecules, but as more and more features were added the visualization grew bigger and had more features that it needed to display.

### Feature Addition

The feature addition was the next step that I was working on and was mainly the biggest part of the project since there was always an additional interesting feature that could be added
that was proposed either by myself or one of the mentors.

The first feature addition that I was working on were the physiochemical properties as well as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of the molecule.

After it was done I started adding features, which would by selecting the checkbox highlight the features mentioned in the checkbox. For example, I implemented pharmacophore checkboxes,
which by selection would highlight the selected pharmacophores, thus by selecting a hydrophobic feature, the atoms of the molecule that are hydrophobic via the `RDKit` pharmacophore
recognition were highlighted in the assigned colors.

Here is a short summary of features that I added for the visualization, which would show a value for the corresponding feature or adjust the figure of the molecule to display the values:

- **Phyisochemical Properties**, **Atom Indices**, **Partial Charges**, **Hydrogen Bond Donors&Acceptors**

And here is a short summary of features, that will highlight a specific atoms and bonds corresponding to their features if they are selected:

- **Rotatable Bonds**, **Partial Charge Heatmap**, **Functional Groups**, **Stereocenters**, **Murcko Scaffold**, **Pharmacophores**

Here I would also address that for the pharmacophores there is a separate checkbox for each of the possible pharmacophore features, thus you can select the specific pharmaocphore feature
that needs to be highlighted.

For the functional groups it currently uses SMART Patterns to identify certain functional groups and will then generate the checkboxes of the functional groups that were recognized and
by selecting them you are able to see the atoms of this functional group.

### Code Restructure

This is also a section that was done throughout the whole project since in the beginning, the code was mainly consisting of functions in one file and this was one of the points that I was
glad that my mentors helped me with since the code restructure allowed me to go from a code that was first based upon only function to structure it with classes and then in the end the
separate classes were moved into separate files, thus a clear structure of the code was created, where every file was distinctive from the other and had an important purpose and a clear
structure 

### Actions, Testing and Documentation

This would be the final part of what I did and here I would put all these three parts together. Pytests were created for this project in addition to the code being uploaded to
[Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/talagayev/mdonatello) to display the coverage of the code. Furthermore, an CI CD was created, which installs the package and tests the pytests on
Linux, MacOS and Windows systems with the Python versions 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 with different `IpyWidgets` versions, with the oldest supported version for this code being `7.6.4`. Finally,
a documentation based on the MDAKits Template was created and can be found here: https://mdonatello.readthedocs.io/

## Current State

The current state of MDonatello is, that it is available and working, thus it can be easily installed and used on your system. Some improvements can be made, but overall
the current version is stable and applicable.

## What's left to do

The code is working, but there is always things that can be improved. The main parts of the code that would need to be improved would be the functional groups, since currently the SMART
Patterns are not optimal and it leads to cases of functional groups overlapping, an example being the recognition of an hydroxyl group in an carboxylic acid group, thus such cases need to
be separated. Additionally, the figure generation is not optimal, since currently it uses `Draw.MolToImage`, which during the discussion with the mentors was decided as an not so good option
and it would need to be adjusted. Additionally, the **Partial Charge Heatmap** is currently mainly highlighting the atoms, but there is an option to display it as a heatmap, which would require
 code adjustment. Then the `update_display` is also not optimal currently and would need to be improved. There are also some small code structure details, that would need to be adjusted for
the code to be more clean and structured and last, but not least the code would need to be moved into the `MDAKits` and also published in `conda-forge` and `pypi` to make it more accessible.

## What code got merged (or not) upstream

There were multiple PRs created for this project, but they were merged to obtain a big and summarized [PR](https://github.com/talagayev/MDonatello/pull/1), which is also the version that is 
used in the [Release](https://github.com/talagayev/MDonatello/releases/tag/0.0.1)

## How to use it

Currently `MDonatello` is a separate package that can be git cloned and installed with the following steps:

First clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/talagayev/MDonatello
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
conda create --name mdonatello
conda activate mdonatello
```

Then go into the MDonatello folder:

```
cd MDonatello
```

Finally this package from source:

```
pip install -e .
```

To use the **mdonatello** package you need to run a jupyter notebook, thus run the command:


```
jupyter notebook
```

Now that you started a jupyter notebook create a notebook file and enter the following command to use **mdonatello**:
Here you need to adjust the name of the PDB File to your PDB File and the resname of the molecule to your molecule

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
import mdonatello
from mdonatello import MoleculeVisualizer

u = mda.Universe("input.pdb")
ag = u.select_atoms("resname UNK")
visualizer = MoleculeVisualizer(ag, show_atom_indices=False, width=-1, height=-1)
```

This would lead you to obtain the following display, where you could then select the molecule and checkboxes:

## Lessons Learned During GSoC

Here I would highlight some lessons that I learned during GSoC2024:

- Have an Idea of the overall structure of the code
- Discuss the ideas with the mentors to see their opinion
- Don't be afraid to ask questions
- Try to work on different aspects of the code (in my case I was almost always only focusing on feature addition and needed to get reminded that there are other parts)
- Try to learn as much from the mentors and apply it in your code
- Getting a meeting with all mentors that have different time zones is sometimes tricky :)

## Conclusion &The Future

It was a fun project and I liked working on it, but the work doesn't stop here. As I mentioned some aspects of the code can be improved and things that can be
done, so I will continue to work on the code after GSoC 2024, here are again the short highlights that I already mentioned that I would work on:

- Code structure improvement
- Figure Generation and SMART Patterns need to be improved
- Heatmap needs to be created for partial charges instead of atom highlighting
- Adding the package to `MDAKits` and `conda-forge`
- New Features can be added
