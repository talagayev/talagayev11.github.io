During the Google Summer of Code 2024 I was working on the 2D Visualization of small molecules, which is an important project, that would allow people to easily visualize the molecule that they have in their file
through the selection of the molecule as an `AtomGroup` in `MDAnalysis`.

## Goals of the project

The goal of the project was to create a code, that would allow the user to select an `AtomGroup` with the help of `MDAnalysis`, which would be used with an RDKit Converter to convert the molecule into and rdkit mol object, which would be used for the visualization.

My Proposal consisted in the following steps:

- Select the AtomGroup via an input from the user via `u = mda.Universe("input.pdb")` to create an MDAnalysis Universe and `ag = u.select_atoms("resname UNK")` to select the `AtomGroup` 
with the molecule that needs to be displayed
- Convert the selected AtomGroup into an rdkit mol object via `ag.convert_to("RDKit")`
- Apply `Chem.RemoveHs` and `AllChem.Compute2DCoords` to obtain a 2D visualization of the molecule
- Display the molecule via `IpyWidgets` with different checkboxes, that by selection would highlight specific parts of the molecule

After discussion with the mentors and suggestions regarding how the code should be structured it was decided that I would procede with this suggestion and would apply the following steps with later on adding the additional
features in the `IpyWidgets` visualization, which would give the user important information in regards to the characteristics of the molecule that is being visualized.
