The last two weeks were very impactful, since now I managed to get the main part of the code and it works. Now I can mainly continue by improving it through adding additional features,
which is being done step by step, with me implementing additional features, while trying to improve the current available ones. The main interesting part of the project is definetly the
meetings, since Richard, Cedric and Yuxuan have experience and give important advices in the coding aspect, which shows that eventhough I am able to get a code that is running I currently
lack the knowledge to construct a good code in the technical sense, thus the meetings help me to try to understand how to make a better code from the technical aspect and what I need to
look for during the creation of the code. The meetings always give me ideas how to improve the code from the technical point with additionally getting some new ideas what I can add into
the 2D visualization. My code that I always worked on previously was consisting only of functions, without a class, so this is also something that I need to adapt, since with this being
the first project where I have a class I need to learn and understand it here. Overall starting from the main code a couple of weeks ago I managed to implement the pharmacophore recognition,
adjusted the code for multiple ligand support, improved the IPywidgets visualization and am currently working adding the functional groups :)

I also need now to adjust the docstrings for the code and start to do the testing and documentation at some point, but I would say I have at least some weeks where I can focus on improving the
main code and add features, before I start doing the tests and the documentation.

Working on code is good, mentoring is good, intersting to see what the next implementations are that I will add and at what point I will see the difference from the technical aspect in the code
that I write :)
