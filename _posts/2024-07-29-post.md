Today is the final day for the submission of my project. I was able to add the final details today to the documnetation, so that everything is now complete for the evaluation.
There are still some parts of the code that can be improved, so I will continue working on the project after the evaluation is done :)

Overall the project was quite nice, from the application process, where I got to know the MDAnalysis code to the bonding period and the coding period.
The mentoring was very nice and helpful, so I liked it very much, thank you Cedric, Richard and Yuxuan :)

Ooverall I learned quite a lot of new details in coding, which I didn't know before and I feel that I improved my coding skills over the course of the
project, which was one of the main reasons that I wanted to participate in GSoC, to improve my coding skills, so for that I am grateful.

So to sum up, thank you again Cedric, Richard and Yuxuan for the nice, helpful and informative mentoring and thanks to the MDAnalysis Community for the possibility
to work on this project, I hope I will be able to continue to contribute to MDAnalysis :)
