Hello, My Name is Valerij Talagayev and I am currently a PhD student at the Free University of Berlin at the [Wolber Lab](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/pharmazie/faecher/pharmazeutische_chemie/wolber/index.html) with my main research topic revolving around [Toll-like receptors](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/pharmazie/faecher/pharmazeutische_chemie/wolber/research/tlr/index.html) and some additional method development with the main works being [OpenMMDL](https://github.com/wolberlab/OpenMMDL). Recently I was selected to participate as an Google Summer of Code 2024 contributor for MDAnalysis with the Topic: [2D Visualization of small molecules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/sfy3kuqc)
